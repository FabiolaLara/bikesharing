Using Tableu

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
For this Challenge we are using "Tableu", which is a interactive tool to present the corresponding values for Data Bases. It is not neccesary to know to program to get the data, it is easy to apply for those who donÂ´t have contact with programming. In this case we wer using a CSV file, however we can extract data from another kid of files like: CSV, PDF, and TXT files, and SQL.

With this data, we want to know the better solution to invest in trips using bicycles in one of the most concurred cities in NY, we could see how the use of bicycles behave during the day, the week, and the differences between our customers or subscribes in using bicycles.

Our mssion is to analize the information, create different graphs or visualizations in order to present them, to take the most optimal decisition for the program Investment.

# Results

## Data presented

In the follow part there are some images which show some analysis od the citi bike analysis.
To start with the following image show how data is display once you open Tableau.

The next image shows the analysis about Checkout Time for Users, this analysis was made to get a visualization of the numbers of bicycles checkouts, filtering the data with the hour of the day, viewing how graphs increase or decrease in certain hour and certain minute of the hour.

The next visualization shows the Checkout Times by Gender, where we can see the demanding of bicycles for each gender, in this case there are 3 types of gender,(0,1,2), where to make it more understandable we apply a filter to visualize these gender and creating a calculated field to display the meaning for these gender.

The next graph display the number Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, these graph shows a darker zone wich mean the peak hours for renting a bicycle, while the lightest shows the opposite, we can have a general idea for the number of trips in the different hours.

Using the same data than the previous visualization we display the numbers of trips by gender each weekday per hour, just we add the created field in the columns in order to see it for each of the different gender.

In this analysis our data contains two columns one for our customers and another for the subscribers, in order to analyze the potential for each one it is important to visualize them in a graph, so we can realize that the subscribers are who rent more bicyles, specially by male gender, we can consider this filter importat in the way to know the type of bicycles which are more convenient to buy.

Another tools there is in Tableau is to create dashboards, these are like another worsheet, just that we can add different worksheets, so we can could have worksheet related in data that we need to display in just one dashboard.

The last part for creating vislualizationn is to create a story, which is another kind of worksheet where we can add worksheet or dashboards to make a final presentation for all the data analysis.

## Checkout Time for Users


There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
