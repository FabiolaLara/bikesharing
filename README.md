Using Tableu

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
For this Challenge we are using "Tableu", which is a interactive tool to present the corresponding values for Data Bases. It is not neccesary to know to program to get the data, it is easy to apply for those who donÂ´t have contact with programming. In this case we wer using a CSV file, however we can extract data from another kid of files like: CSV, PDF, and TXT files, and SQL.

With this data, we want to know the better solution to invest in trips using bicycles in one of the most concurred cities in NY, we could see how the use of bicycles behave during the day, the week, and the differences between our customers or subscribes in using bicycles.

Our mssion is to analize the information, create different graphs or visualizations in order to present them, to take the most optimal decisition for the program Investment.
