# Bikesharing
Using Tableau

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
For this Challenge we are using "Tableau", which is a interactive tool to present the corresponding values for Data Bases. It is not neccesary to know to program to get the data, it is easy to apply for those who donÂ´t have contact with programming. In this case we wer using a CSV file, however we can extract data from another kid of files like: CSV, PDF, and TXT files, and SQL.

Using this tool, we will analyze some data about renting bicycles to find a good solution to invest in these business bicycles in one of the most crowded cities in NY, we could see how the use of bicycles behave during the day, the week, and the differences between our customers or subscribes in using bicycles to mention some of the possible analysis.

Our mission is to analize the information, create different graphs or visualizations and present them, to take the most optimal decisition for the program Investment.

# Results

## Data presented

In the follow paragraphs, there are some images which show some analysis of the citi bike analysis.
To start with, the following image show how data is display once you open Tableau.

The next image shows the analysis about Checkout Time for Users, this analysis was made to get a visualization of the numbers of bicycles checkouts, filtering the data with the hour of the day, viewing how graphs increase or decrease in certain hour and certain minute for each hour.

The next visualization shows the Checkout Times by Gender, where we can see the demanding of bicycles for each gender, in this case there are 3 types of gender,(0,1,2), where to make it more understandable we apply a filter to visualize these gender and creating a calculated field to display the meaning for these gender.

The next graph displays the number Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, these graph shows a darker zone wich mean the peak hours for renting a bicycle, while the lightest shows the opposite, we can have a general idea for the number of trips in the different hours.

Using the same data than the previous visualization we display the numbers of trips by gender each weekday per hour, just we add the created field in the columns in order to see it for each of the different gender.

In this analysis our data contains two columns one for our customers and another for the subscribers, in order to analyze the potential for each one it is important to visualize them in a graph, so we can realize that the subscribers are who rent more bicyles, specially by male gender, we can consider this filter importat in the way to know the type of bicycles which are more convenient to buy.

Another option in Tableau to analyze info, is to create dashboards, these are like another worsheet, just that we can add different worksheets, so we can have worksheet related in data that we need to display in just one dashboard.
In the next image I decided to add the numbers of trips by gender and another worksheet similar but for customers and subscribers also analysing the number of gender that use bikes, I think it is important to have these two together due they are for the same porpuse, to exppose "gender" field.

The last part for creating vislualizationn is to create a story, which is another kind of worksheet where we can add worksheet or dashboards to make a final presentation for all the data analysis. Making stories will summarize all the created worksheets or dashboards while analysisng the info, so we can make a presentation of all the info for our client.

## Summary:
We can say that invesitng in this kind of business could be very profitable, due the amount of visitors in those places,
the culture for using bykes is spread, the streets have the structure to use them, and it is cheaper than using the car or a taxi, then the first steps to think in these business are done. Now the analysis made before explains the amount of users, the number of customers or subscribers, we realized the amount of bycles used each day, at around 17,000 each day, in the peak hours for male, and nearly 9000 for female at the same peak hours. The demanding is continuos each day, as we mentioned before those places are continuosly crowded. Finally with these data info about the nukmber of bikes for the manteinace can be show applying the neccesary conditions or filters, the next image shows the number of id bikes that can be consider for their manteinance, then we can have or inventory for those bikes in order to offers a good quality for the clients.
